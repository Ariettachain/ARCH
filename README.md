What is Arietta Smart Chain?
----------------

Arietta Smart Chain is a cutting-edge blockchain platform that has been designed to be highly compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).  By utilizing Polygon Edge, Arietta Smart Chain benefits from enhanced scalability and reduced transaction costs, enabling users to enjoy fast and efficient transactions without compromising on security or decentralization.

Arietta Smart Chain utilizes the Istanbul BFT (IBFT) 2.0 Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm. This is a consensus mechanism that ensures the network's stability, reliability, and security by relying on a group of trusted validators. This consensus algorithm eliminates the energy-intensive mining process while maintaining a high level of consensus finality and transaction throughput.
